//        The formula youâ€™ll use for this is A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t) where
//
//        P is the principal amount.
//        r is the annual rate of interest.
//        t is the number of years the amount is invested.
//        n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.
//        A is the amount at the end of the investment.
//        Example Output
//        What is the principal amount? 1500
//        What is the rate? 4.3
//        What is the number of years? 6
//        What is the number of times the interest is compounded per year? 4
//        $1500 invested at 4.3% for 6 years compounded 4 times per year is $1938.84.

//        Pseudocode:
//        Read Principal
//        Read rate of interest
//        Read time in years
//        Read number of times interest is compounded per year
//        amount = principal * (1 + rateOfInterest/timesPerYear)^(timesPerYear * time)
//        Check if (amount % .01) > 0
//            Round up one cent
//        Print amount at the end of the investment
